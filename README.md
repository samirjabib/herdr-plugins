# herdr-plugins

Orca Pro Max features rebuilt as [Herdr](https://herdr.dev) plugins: layouts
and mods in gpui-kit JS, each in Herdr's sharing format (a folder laid out
like Herdr's home, with a `RECIPE.md` and a `preview.png`).

## Plugins

| Folder | What it does |
|---|---|
| [`projects-sidebar/`](projects-sidebar/) | Replaces Herdr's Spaces list with projects and their workspaces (git worktrees), groups switched with F1–F3, Add project, and a New workspace dialog that can make the same branch in companion repos and give the agent access to them. Each workspace's branch icon turns green with an open PR and purple once it is merged, with either of your GitHub accounts; a workspace asleep (Orca's moon, which includes one never opened) shows the moon there instead. [Recipe](projects-sidebar/RECIPE.md) |
| [`claude-accounts/`](claude-accounts/) | Orca's Claude usage and accounts: the active account's session, weekly and Fable usage in the sidebar footer, a popover and a panel with every account, Manage Accounts (sign in, add, remove), the account new Claude terminals start on, restarting running Claude terminals onto a new account, and a usage details window. Its CLI publishes the accounts and their usage for other plugins. [Recipe](claude-accounts/RECIPE.md) |
| [`spotlight/`](spotlight/) | Orca Pro Max's Spotlight and test queue: one dev server per repo at its root with the workspace's code projected there, the `spotlight` CLI agents use (`on`/`off`/`status`/`logs`), the test-turn queue with its flask, board and settings, and the sidebar badges. [Recipe](spotlight/RECIPE.md) |
| [`agent-sleep/`](agent-sleep/) | Puts idle Claude Code terminals you aren't looking at to sleep to free memory, and resumes each one when you show its tab, the way Orca's agent hibernation works. Off until you turn it on. |
| [`arc-spaces/`](arc-spaces/) | Cmd-click a link in a terminal and it opens in the Arc space of that workspace's group, with Arc still your default browser. macOS; needs projects-sidebar's groups and one `sudo ln -s`. [Recipe](arc-spaces/RECIPE.md) |
| [`keep-awake/`](keep-awake/) | Orca's "Keep computer awake": a coffee cup in the status bar opens a popup with On (always), Agent (while an agent is working) and Off. It holds macOS's `caffeinate -i -s` for as long as it should, one for every window, and lets go when Herdr quits. Off until you pick a mode. [Recipe](keep-awake/RECIPE.md) |
| [`worktrees/`](worktrees/) | Git worktrees the mac-workspace way in the default layout: each pane header shows its checkout (`project › worktree`) and branch; click it to switch checkouts. The space menu makes and opens worktrees as splits with Claude beside you (in `<project>/worktrees/` for mac-workspace repos), and Clean up removes merged, clean, pushed ones to free space. [Recipe](worktrees/RECIPE.md) |
| [`code-editor/`](code-editor/) | A code editor and Explorer built from how Orca does them. `cmd-l` opens a right panel with a file tree, a filter by name, search inside files and file operations; each file opens in its own tab, with real saving, a warning when the file changes on disk, and a Blame view. One Dark Pro on the whole window, and Material's icons. [Recipe](code-editor/RECIPE.md) |

## Install

```sh
git clone https://github.com/JuanEliasJabib02/herdr-plugins
cd herdr-plugins
scripts/install.sh                                # copies projects-sidebar into ~/.config/herdr-app
herdr-app do layout.switch '{"name":"projects"}'  # ctrl-shift-l switches back
```

- `scripts/install.sh` copies the mods, the layouts and the themes
  (`themes/*.json`), and never overwrites a name it didn't install. It lists
  what it installed in
  `~/.config/herdr-app/.herdr-plugins/projects-sidebar.txt`. Set
  `HERDR_APP_HOME` for another Herdr home.
- **Requires claude-accounts and spotlight:** the projects layout's status
  bar draws spotlight's test-queue flask and, at its right, the
  claude-accounts plugin's Claude usage. The installer installs the plugins
  listed in `projects-sidebar/requires` first, when this repo has their
  folder. Without one, its block shows "<plugin> did not load".
  `scripts/install.sh --alone` installs projects-sidebar only, and
  `--uninstall` never removes the required plugins.
- **Requires agent-sleep too:** the layout's status bar draws its moon, so it
  is installed the same way. Automatic sleep stays off until you turn it on in
  the popup the moon opens.
- **Requires code-editor too:** the layout's right panel draws its Explorer and
  the layout wears its One Dark Pro theme, so it is installed the same way. A
  `themes/one-dark-pro.json` it didn't install stops the install.
- **Requires keep-awake too:** the layout's status bar draws its coffee cup,
  right before the moon, so it is installed the same way. It starts Off, so
  the Mac sleeps as usual until you pick On or Agent in the popup the cup
  opens.
- **Commands on PATH:** a plugin's `bin` file lists executables of its mods
  that the installer links as `~/.local/bin/<name>` to the installed copy
  (spotlight's `spotlight` CLI). The link is recorded in the plugin's
  manifest, a foreign file in the way stops the install, and `--uninstall`
  removes it.
- **Keys:** F1–F3 (groups), plus `cmd-alt-]` / `cmd-alt-[` (next and
  previous space) and `ctrl-1`…`ctrl-9` (the Nth space), which skip Inicio,
  come from the plugin's `keys.json`, which the installer merges into yours. It adds only keys you don't use and backs the file up
  first (`keys.json.bak-<time>`). Once your keys.json is edited, Herdr stops
  adding its new default shortcuts to it. In the projects layout, F2 selects
  group 2 instead of renaming the tab, and `cmd-l` opens and closes the right
  panel. `scripts/install.sh --no-keys`
  skips the merge; then switch groups by clicking, or with
  `herdr-app do projects.group1`.
- **Uninstall:** `scripts/install.sh --uninstall` removes only what the
  install copied. Your keys.json keeps the plugin's lines, and the space
  named Inicio stays open until you close it.

## Where workspaces go

New workspaces are git worktrees at `~/orca/workspaces/<repo>/<name>`, on a
branch named like the workspace. Change `WORKTREE_ROOT` in
`projects-sidebar/mods/projects/config.js` to put them elsewhere. The mod runs
`git` in your repos, including `git fetch origin` before creating.

## Develop

```sh
npm test                                              # pure logic, node --test
herdr-app check "$PWD/projects-sidebar/mods/projects" # the mod loads
scripts/install.sh --no-keys                          # copy your edits into Herdr
```

Herdr doesn't load a mod folder that is a symlink, so the installer copies.
After an edit, run it again and Herdr hot-reloads the copy a moment later.
`herdr-app check` draws only the tree view: to check another view, use a copy
whose `main.js` defaults to it.

`scripts/install.sh claude-accounts` installs the other plugin. Its views are
checked with `scripts/check-views.sh claude-accounts/mods/claude-accounts
footer popup panel accounts confirm details`, which makes such a copy per
view. `scripts/check-snapshot.sh <task> <files…> [-- <views…>]` runs the
suite and those checks on `HEAD` plus the given files, so tasks that share a
worktree don't check each other's unfinished edits.
