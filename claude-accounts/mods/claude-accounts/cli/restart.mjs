//
// afterUse(from, to): called by accounts.use once `active` is written, with
// the previous and the new account ids. Orca's
// handleRunningClaudeSessionsAfterSwitch:
//   1. Any earlier pending-switch.json is dropped (a new switch replaces the
//      question).
//   2. Queue rules: a switch item that hasn't stopped Claude yet is dropped
//      when its terminal is now on `to`; the others follow `to` (an accepted
//      restart relaunches on whatever is selected when it runs).
//   3. switchMode keep: nothing else.
//   4. The Claude terminals (D7) split into onAccount (on `from`, as D18's
//      runsOnAccount reads it), elsewhere (on another account) and cantMove:
//      reason "own-program" (Claude is
//      the terminal's program), "no-session" (no session file, or a session
//      with no transcript yet: nothing to resume, Orca's rule), "shared-session" (another
//      terminal holds the same session id), "unknown-account" (its session
//      lives in a folder no account has) or "unreadable" (hc couldn't read
//      it: Orca's "Couldn't check N terminals"). Terminals already on `to`,
//      as D18 reads it too, aren't listed. D19: a terminal whose switch item
//      to `from` has already stopped Claude (headingTo) is onAccount
//      whatever the scan read, since mid-restart it reads the old Claude, a
//      shell or a new Claude with no session file yet.
//   5. restart: each onAccount terminal is queued as a switch item, and a
//      runner is spawned. A live resume job keeps the terminal out, and so
//      does a live switch item already heading to `to` (D19); the new item
//      waits behind any other one that already stopped Claude.
//   6. pending-switch.json gets {from, to, at, mode, sessions} when there's
//      something to say: an onAccount session, or an unreadable or shared
//      one. Each session is {terminal, title, prompt, account, group,
//      reason, status}, what the dialog's row shows (D23, Orca's
//      SessionRow): title is the terminal's title (hc's, else its
//      "workspace / tab"), or null; prompt is the conversation's last
//      prompt (terminals.mjs lastPrompt), or null; status is the session
//      file's "idle" or "busy" when the switch looked (the dialog then
//      reads it live), null when there's no session. A D19 row (still
//      restarting) is "busy", with its item's session's prompt, and title
//      null when the scan didn't list it. `mode` is "ask" or "restart", so the mod (T7's toasts.react)
//      tells them apart: mode "ask" with an onAccount session opens the
//      confirm view; mode "restart" is the restart toast, and its Review
//      opens the confirm view on the sessions that aren't onAccount (they're
//      already restarting). The confirm view answers with --answer.
//
// The runner (`restart --detach`, spawned detached with stdio ignored, so
// exec's 30 s cap never cuts it): under the D2 lock it claims every item
// that's neither final nor claimed, then runs one async loop per claimed
// item, so a busy terminal never holds up another. It refreshes its claims'
// `at` every heartbeat and exits when its loops end. An item waits while
// another item on its terminal has stopped Claude, unless that one's runner
// is gone. Per item (D8):
//   1. Waits, with no cap, until the terminal's Claude is idle (state
//      waitingIdle, written once), or, for a switch item, until Claude's own
//      turn is over (lastTurn) and it isn't blocked on a question, even with
//      background subagents still running (Orca's isClaudePaneMidTurn),
//      while the terminal lives and its account
//      still differs from the item's `to`. Right before acting it re-reads
//      the terminal (D7): a switch item already on its target is dropped
//      (Orca's consumePendingPaneAccountRestart); a resume job already on it
//      only sends its message. A switch item whose Claude quit on its own
//      (a /exit by hand), leaving the shell in the foreground, goes straight
//      to step 4, as Orca's pending restart fires once Claude is gone; with
//      nothing to resume, or with its terminal closed or another program in
//      front, it's dropped. A resume job in those cases fails. A
//      session with no transcript (a `/clear` nobody has written to yet)
//      fails, and Claude is never stopped. A Claude with no session file
//      (one stopped at a startup dialog, resume-gaps D4) has no turn that
//      ends: after TIMING.dialog (10 min) of such readings in a row the
//      item fails, Claude never stopped, with "Claude in <t> is asking
//      “<question>”; answer it and switch again" when its screen shows a
//      dialog (dialog.mjs), else "Claude in <t> has had no session file
//      for 10 min". A switch item never restarts a Claude agent-sleep is
//      putting to sleep or put to sleep (its sleeping.json, read only,
//      resume-gaps D5; agent-sleep's wake starts it on the active account):
//      with the shell back and a "stopping" or "asleep" record, it's
//      dropped; right before stopping an idle Claude, an "asleep" record
//      drops it and a "stopping" one keeps it waiting, since agent-sleep
//      can still undo that stop.
//   2. stopping: SIGTERM to the foreground pid (probe b4). From here on the
//      item can't be cancelled.
//   3. Waits up to 30 s for the shell to be the foreground again, else
//      timeout.
//   4. starting: types `CLAUDE_ACCOUNTS_DIR=<target dir> claude <kept args>
//      --resume <sid>`, each part shell-quoted, with `hc send`. A failed
//      send is failed with the line to run by hand.
//   5. Waits up to 120 s for the new Claude to report idle, else timeout.
//      Its session file must lie in the target's dir, else landedElsewhere.
//      When the shell is back in the foreground for 5 s with no new Claude
//      (Claude refused the resume, "No conversation found…", and exited),
//      it fails at once: detail is the error Claude left on the screen
//      (`hc read`), then the line to run by hand. Each poll the new Claude
//      isn't idle (and the shell isn't in front), its screen is read: at a
//      startup dialog (D4) the item gets `question: "<question>"`, written
//      when it changes (the mod toasts it), and the 120 s cap waits. When
//      the dialog goes, `question` goes and the 120 s start over. Still
//      asking after TIMING.dialog: timeout, detail "the new Claude is still
//      asking “<question>” in <t>; answer it there".
//   6. A resume job with a message, or a switch item that stopped running
//      subagents (relaunchMessage names them for the resumed Claude):
//      sending, `hc send` as the user (no HC_TERMINAL_ID). Then done.
// A failed, timed-out or orphaned item's detail is `<why>: <the line to run
// by hand>`; the two D4 cases have no line, since Claude is running there
// (never stopped, or already started again). A final item has no
// `question`. A non-final item whose runner died (its claim void: a dead pid,
// or an `at` older than the stale window) reads failed "runner gone"
// whenever restart.json is read under the lock, and stays failed: it's never
// run again. Final items are pruned 24 h after they ended.
